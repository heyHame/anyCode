# AnyCode
Anycode is based on No Code(https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode). <br>
If you code with Anycode, you will enjoy the experience of it. <br>
I have to say, Anycode is the next-generation programming language. <br>
# Simple Tutorial
So first, let's make a hello-world application using Anycode.
```

```
(**SEE, THAT SIMPLE.
YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE YOU'RE WRITING SOMETHING INTERESTING,
AND YOU DID.**) <br>
The output looks like this:
```

```
If you see **nothing**, your eyesight is fine. That creates absolutely **nothing** but
if you imagine there's something in your terminal, there **is** something on your terminal.

And I have created a state-of-the-art high-performance algorithm using my Programming language:
```
void stateOfTheArtAlgorithm()
{[nocode]                   }
```
See? You can use almost any grammar in this language. You can also write your function like this:
```
def stateOfTheArtAlgorithm {
[nocode]         ;return 0;}
```
Both of the functions produce a **great** answer that you'll never know what that means.
<br>But there are neither errors nor warnings during the compiling procedure. Discover the joy of Anycode!
## How to compile it?
I have written some compilers using C/C++ and other languages.
